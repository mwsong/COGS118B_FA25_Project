COGS 118b Project

Our project explores unsupervised analysis of mushroom images using pretrained CLIP embeddings. We apply PCA for dimensionality reduction and use clustering methods such as K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Models, Agglomerative Clustering, Spectral Clustering, and DBSCAN to study how mushroom images group in embedding space. Our goal is to examine whether combining visual and textual information improves how well different mushroom species separate without training a supervised classifier.
